# Churn-Customer-Analysis-using-EDA
"Churn Customer Analysis using EDA" is a data analysis project focused on understanding customer churn through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The project visualizes key patterns, such as churn rates by demographic, service usage, and customer behavior. 


Insights from Customer Churn Prediction Analysis

    Data Preparation and Cleaning: Conducted data cleaning and preprocessing, converting categorical variables and ensuring the accuracy of numerical values, which improved the dataset's integrity for analysis.

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Utilized Python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to perform EDA, including correlation heatmaps and distribution visualizations, uncovering insights on key factors influencing customer churn.

    Statistical Testing: Performed Chi-square tests to analyze the relationship between categorical variables (e.g., gender, Internet service, and contract type) and churn, revealing statistically significant associations that inform retention strategies.

    Model Development and Evaluation: Developed a logistic regression model, achieving an accuracy of 80% on the test set and identifying important features influencing churn, such as monthly charges and contract type.

    Hyperparameter Tuning: Implemented GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning, enhancing model performance and achieving a cross-validation score of 81%, leading to more reliable churn predictions.

    Feature Importance Analysis: Analyzed model coefficients to rank features by importance, providing actionable insights for targeted marketing strategies to improve customer retention.
